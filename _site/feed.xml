                <title>Microsoft: New Outlook sends sensitive data to Microsoft</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;especially-in-it-trust-is-everything-and-working-with-different-solutions-and-providers-is-always-a-matter-of-trust-the-possible-fact-that-microsofts-new-outlook-offshout-is-seemingly-sending-sensitive-data-to-redmond-could-shake-the-world-it-to-its-very-foundations---years-after-the-once-acquired-mobile-outlook-app-did-the-same&quot;&gt;Especially in IT, trust is everything and working with different solutions and providers is always a matter of trust. The possible fact that Microsoft’s new Outlook-offshout is seemingly sending sensitive data to Redmond could shake the world IT to its very foundations - years after the once acquired mobile Outlook-app did the same.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the growing inconsistency of the classic and “new”, often undercooked iterations of Microsoft Desktop-applications (you may have noticed this with Teams and Outlook already), the latest Windows-version seems to be quite keen on submitting IMAP- and SMTP-credentials to Microsoft-servers as German site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-krallt-sich-Zugangsdaten-Achtung-vorm-neuen-Outlook-9357691.html&quot;&gt;heise.de&lt;/a&gt; reported this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;everything-new&quot;&gt;Everything “new”?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking highly of the “new Outlook”, &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602&quot;&gt;Microsoft’s plan is that this new version is about to replace&lt;/a&gt; the abandoned Windows Mail and the well-known, monolithic desktop client on Windows and macOS. Users can already switch to the new Outlook but while several elemental features (on-premises Exchange-support, PST-support on Mac etc.) are missing, the way Redmond deals with personal information and login credentials is quite questionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/New_Outlook_Welcome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft-apps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2023-Windows 11-update already implements “Outlook (new)” into the start menu under “Recommended apps” so many users may give this a try - but substituting margarine for butter doesn’t always have the effect usually hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/new_outlook_win11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Outlook deployed within an update&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In detail, adding a new account to the new Outlook which isn’t hosted by Microsoft, a certain reference is given, explaining that “non-Microsoft-accounts are synched with the Microsoft” cloud as stated &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/synchronisieren-ihres-kontos-in-outlook-mit-der-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981?ui=de-de&amp;amp;rs=de-de&amp;amp;ad=de&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in German. At the time of writing, only iCloud-, Gmail-, Yahoo- and general IMAP-accounts and the Microsoft 365-stack are supported (and therefore synced!), including the versions on iOS, Android and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/new_outlook_sync_warning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft-apps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this notify, adding an IMAP-account to the new Outlook comes equal with syncing E-Mails with Microsofts servers. Existing contacts and calendard-entries won’t get synced but everything what is created in the new Outlook afterwards gets a direct injection into the Microsoft Cloud for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentioning the note above which things are synced, users may question the intention behind this move. Why does the vendor of my software application not only need to save the credentials for a personal mailbox but also presume to access the personal data of users and sync them with their own systems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;heise.de was able to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-lays-hands-on-login-data-Beware-of-the-new-Outlook-9358925.html&quot;&gt;sniff the traffic&lt;/a&gt; between new Outlook and the Microsoft-servers, proving that the output contained the target server, login name and password which were sent to Microsoft-servers. Although the connection itself appeared to be TLS-protected, the data was sent to Microsoft in plain text within the tunnel. Without informing or inquiring about this, Microsoft grants itself access to the IMAP-and SMTP login data of users of the new Outlook which is, basically, an undeniable no-go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-now&quot;&gt;What now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, user should sit this deployment out as long as possible. There are enough alternatives around to connect IMAP-accounts with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thunderbird.net/&quot;&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt; being probably the most-famous one. There can be no reason for Microsoft doing this and while Redmond already caused an outcry years ago when the acquired - now - Outlook Mobile-app did already send credentials to third parties, using this new half-cooked app for whatever reason is an imminent threat for everything at least slightly connected to data protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/matthew-manuel-BhLSBX-0rnM-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft-apps&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, this is seemingly only affecting IMAP-accounts but as Outlook is also mostly used in the Enterprise, it is more than questionable what Microsoft tries to achieve with this move. I don’t want neither my private mails, calendars and contacts nor my credentials to the accounts hosting those transmitted to the creator of a Personal Information Managed. Considering the latest bad press on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/hackers-stole-microsoft-signing-key-from-windows-crash-dump/&quot;&gt;stolen keys&lt;/a&gt; of Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure, this whole thing comes with a very bad taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I have used Microsoft-products my whole life and am partially still doing so in private while I have to rely on them in business life - wether I like it or not. But the inconsistency of new software (just switch between the classic and “new” Outlook on Mac) or the undercooked releases (old Teams? New Teams?) just cast long shadows on Redmond’s quality of code and the common alignment of Microsoft as a vendor. Combined with the dreadful firing of new, partially unwanted, features or software, the a feeble impression comes up that there doesn’t seem to be any common theme except the wild gathering of data for whatsoever reason - which matches my personal impressions on the development of Microsoft Edge which started as a great alternative to Chrome but turned to a  meeting point of unwanted features over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/new_outlook_bfdi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GDPR-issue?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gdpr-calling&quot;&gt;GDPR calling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, Professor Ulrich Kelber, is alarmed by the data detour in Microsoft’s new Outlook. On Mastodon he informed about the intention &lt;a href=&quot;https://social.bund.de/@bfdi/111381793883035665&quot;&gt;to ask for a report from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner&lt;/a&gt; who is told to be responsible for companies like Microsoft, during a meeting of the European data protection supervisory authorities next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s up to us users to answer and react - and for everyone directly in charge of enforcing GDPR-compliances, this may be a new target to definitely aim and focus at and especially businesses should keep Outlook’s journey under review!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Is Bluesky worth a visit?</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;while-many-people-and-even-corporate-brands-are-fleeing-from-x---formerly-known-as-twitter---the-question-is-which-service-is-able-to-provide-shelter-the-fediverse-with-products-like-mastodon-or-misskeycalckeyfirefish-is-definitely-an-option-while-jack-dorsey-former-twitter-ceo-and-co-founder-tries-to-gather-up-the-masses-with-his-latest-project-bluesky&quot;&gt;While many people and even corporate brands are fleeing from X - formerly known as “Twitter” - the question is which service is able to provide shelter. The Fediverse with products like Mastodon or Misskey/Calckey/Firefish is definitely an option while Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and Co-founder, tries to gather up the masses with his latest project, Bluesky.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Social Network-landscape is shattered these days. While the downfall of X was somehow a predictable process, it is still astonishing how fast a service that once was a synonym for short messaging is ruined while (seemingly) hazarding all consequences. Anyway, each failure is a chance for optimization and so other networks with the focus on decentralization grew over the years - one of them, virtually flagshipping The Fediverse, was Mastodon. Besides, and somehow lurking in the shadows, the virtual successor of Twitter has been in the works for four years using an investment of nearly 13 millions USD: Bluesky, lead by Jay Graber and former Twitter-CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey - a decentralized new social network based upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://atproto.com/guides/overview&quot;&gt;AT-protocol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/boliviainteligente-elSx3uwGhBw-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;X dot com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;from-bluebird-to-bluesky&quot;&gt;From bluebird to Bluesky&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, Bluebird’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; looks quite simple - and yes, it’s work in progress. Getting onboarded isn’t as easy because the access to the new Social Network is - in my eyes - crippled intentionally. Not everyone can sign up, people need invite codes - everyone of you who thought this scenario reminding on the old days of early OnePlus-smartphones has been put to a grave is wrong. You need an invite code to play in the sandbox of Bluesky - and getting those may be a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_start.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Simply blue&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, celebrities and people or organizations of public interest join the platform to attract new followers and subscribers. In moments where many of those flee from X.com, Bluesky is a welcomed new home and especially here in Germany, this escape-scenario drastically increased throughout the last months with many famous accounts migrating to Bluesky: Good bait catches fine fish and with a solid base of well-known accounts, people automatically get interested in following those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_register.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Registering&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should you be able to get an invite code (users who are with the platform a little bit longer get those for example), there is no obstacle towards subscribing to Bluesky anymore as the web interface is definitely not a complicated one: Create your account by choosing your provider, enter your invite code (or join the waitlist), pick your handle, enter your E-mail address and password and you’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_invite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Where&apos;s the invite?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that easy if the trending thing about entering Bluesky wasn’t the artificially-truncated invite code thing. I personally don’t know if this is because of making the service more “exclusive” or keeping spammers and bots outside - finally, this scenario does its work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to get an invite - just be patient and wait until your spot in the waitlist is next, get a code from another Bluesky-user or look for initiatives like, for example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailbox.org/en/post/mailbox-org-opens-bluesky-invitation-code-exchange-platform&quot;&gt;invitation exchange platform&lt;/a&gt; of German provider mailbox.org - paying customers can request an invite or share their codes with others: In my case, I didn’t wait a half day until (unexpectedly) the mail with an invite reached me (pure luck or less demand - who knows?)-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_waitlist.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Joining the waitlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-steps&quot;&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you made it to scavenge an invite code and used it for good, you probably have created your account with the @bsky.social-appendix and the outlook will be quite similar to Twitter in earlier days. Indeed Bluesky focuses on the essentials while missing some of those well-known ones, but you definitely will feel familiar straight from the first visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_overview.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the left pane, you see self-declaring links for your home site, the general feed, current notifications, moderation statistics, your profile and general settings. The middle shows the feed with accounts you’ve subscribed to, the right side displays a search box, an option to discover other accounts and more feeds. The latter are indeed custom algorithms that users can build with a little coding expertise as documented &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/jelleke-vanooteghem-gnxb59lGU1M-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bluesky&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verification&quot;&gt;Verification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no blue, yellow, gold, whatsoever checkmark to verify your identity (yet). Instead, you can change your handle, for example @oliverpifferi.bsky.social, to - in my case - @pifferi.info by adding a certain DNS-entry to a domain you own. It’s still not the way of a knightly accolade, but what can proof your online identity better than access to the DNS-settings of a domain you own by yourself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, enter the settings and use the “change handle”-option just like you would do when changing it into another @bsky.social-tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The way to change your handle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the “I have my own domain”-option here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_change_handle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Do you have your own domain?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now another windows will appear with the verification-settings you need to enter into the DNS-settings of your domain. Enter the domain in the upper field and see which TXT-entry will be generated afterwards. This entry with the _atproto-prefix and the specific value must then be added to your site’s DNS-configuation as a new entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Bluesky_change_handle_settings.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The way to change your handle&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One you have done this in a separate window, click on “Verify DNS record” and, depending on your provider, your account will be verified, permanently changing your handle to, in this case, @alice.com (or, @pifferi.info in mine). In case you don’t have access to the DNS-console, you may also place a TXT-file in the webroot of your specific website and verify it via this way. Further information on verification on Bluesky can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://blueskyweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19001802873101-How-to-Set-your-Domain-as-your-Handle&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally&quot;&gt;Finally…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bluesky looks like X/Twitter once used to look. It still misses features that many former users got used to and while the whole platform is definitely in the status of “work in progress”, it is definitely fill up with many people flooding from X or users who run their Bluesky-account parallel to their Mastodon-one - which is quite interesting. If you don’t mind starting with a new social network created by the same crypto bro that once was in charge of ancient Twitter before selling the whole platform (and if you’re okay with this possibly happening again), Bluesky may stand for the simplicity that once made the former bluebird that popular. The classical PR-B/S of “federated” and “decentralized” is something that needs to be proven in the future - without the approach of an open, really decentralized and federated standard, just another siloed platform has just been born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then, and with direct messages possibly being integrated sometimes in the future, Bluesky may be an alternative based on “yet another protocol”. It looks slim, is trimmed down to basic functions and you will probably find lots of people that fled from X - but, as always, it will be interesting to watch how this platform will grow and develop once the artificially-shortened signup process has been erased and in how far it can compete with the Fediverse in terms of “building a healthier community”. Most of the people fleeing from “the other side” need to find a new comfortable home, just a few of them will care about where the data is being stored. Considering that all your posts on Bluesky are available via API-endpoints without any kind of authentication at the time of writing (see my post in raw &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.social/xrpc/com.atproto.repo.listRecords?repo=pifferi.info&amp;amp;collection=app.bsky.feed.post&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for example), “Privacy” could also be an interesting topic to deal with when opting in for any new platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/ehimetalor-akhere-unuabona-TvJk52iLxQA-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stay connected&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stream-of-time&quot;&gt;Stream of time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, time will (as always) tell but as someone who changed to Mastodon for quite a while and running an own instance, even Bluesky has its charm and reminds on times where Social Networking was less toxic than it is today. In the end, usability and the people, groups and institutions on the specific platform will shape the foundation for more or less success - this is a challenge all solutions of the “post-Twitter”-era have to deal with inevitably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering the results of all these thoughts, Bluesky IS worth a visit at the time of writing, despite the silly invite-system - but don’t expect a fully-matured platform like the former Twitter or Mastodon &amp;amp; Co!  It still is work in progress and although the current approach serves our nostalgic memories quite well, missing hashtags-support, no possible video-uploads or even basic things like 2FA in terms of security show that there is still a long way to go. Speaking of federation and decentralization I am also quite curious if the self-hosting on own Bluesky-servers based upon the AT-protocol will be possible like we know this from the Fediverse-solutions. Time will tell but any option is better than the remains of the social network that once made use to know what’s going on in the world with 140 characters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in joining me on either &lt;a href=&quot;https://norse.social/@oliver&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/pifferi.info&quot;&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;? Click the specific link on each service and you’ll be guided to my respective profile and let us mutually discover how the social media landscape will change in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The unhealthful peak of Internet service pricing</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;while-we-mainly-rely-on-subscription-based-internet-services-these-days-it-is-more-than-obvious-that-with-saturation-of-demand-the-peak-of-user-acceptance-in-terms-of-constantly-raised-pricing-has-been-reached-while-the-market-is-in-a-state-of-odd-turmoil&quot;&gt;While we mainly rely on subscription-based Internet services these days, it is more than obvious that, with saturation of demand, the peak of user acceptance in terms of constantly-raised pricing has been reached while the market is in a state of odd turmoil.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common and widespread modus operandi is currently swashing through the Internet: Over many consecutive years, many vendors and providers have invested into the specific infrastructure and the current look n’ feel of the services we know today. In 2020, I already asked if “&lt;a href=&quot;../Services-its-all-about-them-now/&quot;&gt;It’s all about services - now&lt;/a&gt;” and as the answer was a clearer “YES!” than we all may have assumed three years ago, I also pondered “&lt;a href=&quot;../Why-Apple-One-hasnt-absolutely-convinced-me-yet/&quot;&gt;why Apple One hasn’t convinced me&lt;/a&gt;” this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I subscribed anyway (the bargain with six family members, 2 TB of iCloud-space, custom domains and Apple Music amongst the favorite services was just too luring for $29,99 then!), we have to talk about the progress - and possible downfall - of the Internet service landscape in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/1-MFq8WM-HN7Jng7GWENlVPg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Service in progress&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan always stays the same when introducing new products: Enter the market with pricey offerings while investing into the infrastructure, operate in the red while going for market saturation, optimize (in whatsoever direction), cut down account sharing (hello, Netflix), implement commercials (got it, Amazon?) and… finally… raise the prices over a certain  time (you - everyone!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fully understand that implementing a certain service infrastructure and ecosystem does need lots of upfront invests but looking at the streaming- and services-landscape in the dying 2023, the customer’s bargain seems to lower more and more while prices are - partially - leveling into pointless dimensions that are difficult to justify. Anyway, come and join me through my thoughts of needed (or not needed) subscriptions that affect our six-people-household - and if there is any way at all to save money or reallocate saved bucks from one to the other service!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/robynne-hu-HOrhCnQsxnQ-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Net today&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;netflix&quot;&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix implemented advertising and is, reportedly, killing its base plan for one device here in Germany just like it has happened in the USA and Canada before - which is always an indicator what will happen in Europe sooner or later. Carrying on the sabotage of the long-countenanced account sharing (which my brother in law used with a profile on my account), I really had a thought whether we need to pay for four concurrent streams or not - with one 16- and one 13-year old daughter there are times of clash, but hey: Two simultaneously streams still serve well as we (unsurprisingly) have alternatives like Disney+, Paramount+ or - you name it - Apple TV+ - while watching in 4K and HDR is just something I do mind in our household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/mollie-sivaram-yubCnXAA3H8-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Watching Netflix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result here: Raising the premium plan from 17,99 EUR to 19,99 EUR doesn’t sound that much but will seemingly drive me to definitely reduce my need for four streams, lowering those to two for 13,49 EUR instead of 12,99 EUR (current pricing). Periodically Netflix is definitely worth binge-watching some new shows but keeping up with the premium plan just for this case isn’t necessary - and we have got alternatives so albeit this difference isn’t that much money, it’s noticeable and will be changed in accordance to our family needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendency: Reducing the plan to Full HD and two streams, therefore saving 6,50 EUR in new pricing per month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prime-video&quot;&gt;Prime Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon’s video streaming service is the first one we subscribed for - and this not because of the offering but just for getting our Amazon-orders with next-day delivery. Although the prices have also increased over the years, additional channels which you can additionally subscribe to or the commercial-backed Freevee-platform were added over time. No need for this yet so Amazon Prime Video will stay no matter what. Amazon’s own shows are worth watching and despite more content or movies mainly come with additional costs, 0,99 €-actions before the weekends often bring various good movies or some hidden gems for a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/glenn-carstens-peters-EOQhsfFBhRk-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Amazon Prime Video&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendency: Leaving it untouched, especially because of the next-day-delivery and many Amazon-branded shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;disney&quot;&gt;Disney+&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely one of the aspects why I don’t understand Netflix raising the prices again and again: Due to licensing rights, many contents previously shown on Netflix wandered into Disney’s roster. Besides, the back catalogue of the Walt Disney Company including many classic movies and cartoons pair with the ultimate collection of Marvel- and Star Wars content or evergreens like The Simpsons, Justified and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a six-people household with two kids older and two kids younger than ten, there is barely no way around Disney for me despite the upcoming price raise in November. The question here is the same than with Netflix - do I need two or four concurrent streams? If I stay with two (and Full HD), my monthly subscription expenses for Disney+ won’t change - if I go with four, 11,99 € would be the new price which makes an increase of three EUR per month with upcoming regulations on account sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/thibault-penin-hitikwrSIVQ-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Disney&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendency here: Stay with two and juggle with the other two using Netflix simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paramount&quot;&gt;Paramount+&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The youngest of the streaming services and - until now - another bargain for 7,99 EUR a month. To good to stay that cheap and yet rumors have raised that Paramount is planning various new subscription models and maybe an advertising-supported plan. I discovered the service with “Star Trek” and stayed there because of shows like “Tulsa King”, “Mayor of Kingstown”, “Special Ops: Lioness”, “Chemistry of Death” or “From”. Perceived, we do still find more quality content with less burden on this platform and hopefully this will be the fact in the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/boliviainteligente-TKKvG5iB1wg-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Paramount+&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendency: Will be kept and likely limited to two streams (I am sure this plan will be offered when the first changes will appear!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-one&quot;&gt;Apple One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, my personal Pandora’s box - over the time, I (of course) subscribed to Apple One which once was 28,95 EUR when it started and was raised to 31,95 EUR in December 2022. With two teenagers and two parents heavily using Photos, it had to be the 2 TB storage plan (which I once used anyway with family sharing) and Apple Music as our preferred streaming service entered the party, too. This price was okay and with it, Apple TV+ came along which I don’t watch that regularly, but some shows like “See”, “Infiltration” or especially “For all Mankind” and the legendary “Ted Lasso” showed that Apple is rather going with “all killers, no fillers”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/laurenz-heymann-VkfhJLz5SMQ-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Store Hamburg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, now we are facing yet another price increase and the whole Premium-package is going to be raised to 34,95 EUR a month here in Germany and I am already considering leaving this all-in-one-offer. Fitness+ and Arcade are nice services, none of them are offers I would subscribe to anyway. Apple News is something that will probably never come to Germany so it’s all about the 2 TB iCloud, Apple Music and TV+ while the other services are nice to have, but rarely used and - at least with our use case - somehow disposable. iCloud Drive is still often laggy and has syncing issues, (free) sharing to external users without an Apple ID is still impossible: Would there be any chance to sync my Apple-based apps with platforms like Nextcloud for example, this would make iCloud definitely dispensable - so there is still the need to finally, finally, really finally improve iCloud like I already wrote back in &lt;a href=&quot;../Why-Apple-needs-to-strengthen-and-upgrade-iCloud/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;. At least Cupertino has finally implemented custom &lt;a href=&quot;../Apple-iClouds-custom-domain-feature-is-secretly-available-now/&quot;&gt;E-Mail-domains&lt;/a&gt; in August 2021 but speaking about DMARC, DKIM and SPF, there is still a lot of work to do for paying Plus-customers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/Apple_One_11_2023.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Apple One-pricing in Germany, November 2023&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tendency: Really looking to split up the services: The 2 TB-plan is mandatory but doesn’t contain data outside Apple’s app-microcosm, this scenario is served by Nextcloud. Apple Music is also quite mandatory as the pricing being compared to Spotify doesn’t differ (and Spotify is also going to overhaul its pricing) and Apple TV+ may be the only thing that may be booked on a monthly, spontaneous basis. Arcade and Health are two services that might be given a miss as they are nice to have, but also rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to a conclusion, we may just hope that the unhealthful peak of Internet service pricing has been reached but, as always, there always seems to be one direction: Upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we users had our benefits over many, many years: A big catalogue, fair pricing and - later - a good competition before more and more services appeared, licenses were moved and contents as well. Maybe we got used to the “I-can-watch-everything-everytime”-feeling and thought that the current pricing and tolerated account sharing would last. Maybe we became to cushy so that it is now on the customer’s side to differentiate between the services, contents and the pricing. I still think we have a choice but subscribing to everything without utilizing a service up to a specific percentage will become more expensive while losing subscribers because of new pricing is surely a calculated risk of any subscription-based provider named above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/javier-allegue-barros-C7B-ExXpOIE-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We have a choice&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I don’t expect price drop in the distant future so customers will be forced to judge which services are really needed and terminate those that aren’t - or go with if-and-only-if-partial subscriptions, binge-watch (for example) and cancel the subscription again. This may be an unhealthful peak of today’s streaming landscape but I think it’s well-calculated and long overdue after good bait catches fine fish over all the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies indeed must to find arguments to further tie customers to a specific platform and although we live in a six-people-household, I will definitely tune down the one or other subscription if I am needed to - amongst those candidates like Netflix, Disney and… now… Apple!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How to fix seemingly disabled Apple Pay on macOS</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-arent-many-glitches-with-macos-in-my-common-use-cases-but-lately-and-after-migrating-my-user-from-one-mac-to-the-other-i-realized-that-seemingly-apple-pay-was-deactivated-for-whatever-reason&quot;&gt;There aren’t many glitches with macOS in my common use cases but lately and after migrating my user from one Mac to the other, I realized that, seemingly, Apple Pay was deactivated for whatever reason.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although FileVault was enabled and my fingerprints were registered for use with Touch ID, the message “Apple Pay has been disabled because the security settings of this Mac were modified” appeared when trying to add my credit cards to Wallet/Apple Pay on the new device. This error appeared the first time in connection with the Migration Assistant on macOS Ventura 13.0 and moved on to Sonoma 14.0 while Internet sources tell it has already been around since 2020 so this issue may not be that new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/macOS-apple-pay-disabled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The error&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is as astonishing as straightforward and may be fixed in a different setting one may expect: After some research, many users reported that it has something to do with the state of macOS-related updates. Indeed, going to Software Update/Advanced and unchecking the “Install system data files and security updates”-option with enabling it again shortly afterwards, this problem was fixed in no time. Apparently it appeared when moving one user account to a new machine, telling the system that something has been happened to the security hardware underneath (which was the fact).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/macos-apple-pay-enable_updates.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The fix&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the reason for this issue to appear is reasonable but the way it can be fixed is somehow confusing. Besides this, the workaround must be done using an account with administrative permissions - as I tend to have one administrator on my devices while working with a standard user, this may be helpful as well: As a standard user, you can disable and enable the “Install system data files and security updates”-option and authenticate with the administrative account but this won’t erase the error - you’ll have to perform these steps with the local administrator of your Mac!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Stop worrying about people that aren’t worried about you</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;2020-and-2021-had-some-steep-learning-curves-in-my-evaluation-of-relationships-with-other-individuals-and-even-these-days-experience-is-growing-as-you-never-stop-learning&quot;&gt;2020 and 2021 had some steep learning curves in my evaluation of relationships with other individuals and even these days, experience is growing as you never stop learning…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was always interested to make even foreign people like me in earlier years, I somehow managed to change this attitude over the time - maybe boosted by COVID? Now, we are facing the second quite devastating year in a row, I often found me confronting myself with the question if I really need to please just everyone on a private and business basis. Wouldn’t be the status of just getting along with fewer, worthy people outside my own family and circle of friends even more important? Some thoughts on that with the wisdom I may have gained over the years, paired with social distancing thanks to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing it in a realistic way, nobody’s perfect. But trying your best to be the person you want to be is everything that should matter. Be true to yourself and to people close to you and always do what you believe in, no matter what others say. I was never the guy with tons of friends, indeed my best three friends live more than 75 kilometers away from me and we know each other for 15 to 20 years. Many people from which I thought they were friends turned their back to me once my private life was focusing on becoming a dad, therefore having less time to party or drink. Looking back (which I rarely try to do!) they were just company in specific parts of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us be grateful to people who make us happy, they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Marcel Proust), French Author&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/timon-studler-ABGaVhJxwDQ-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo by Timon Studler / Unsplash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in the coming autumn of 2023, I’ve learned some more lessons. People you could get along with in terms of your job can instantly turn their back to you once you decide to stop working for a specific employee. Or revive the stab-in-the-back-myth. Or suddently turn silent due to restriction made by the employer you’re planning to leave. These experiences sound quite childish and stupid and I never expected job-related relationships to develop these ways but what a fool I have been to underestimate the reaction to one’s own free will. You fought. You oared. You struggled. You encouraged. You helped. You sold. You educated. In the end, you decided to leave the train at a certain station and, sadly, the outcome is nearly the expected one and yet another lesson in life. Ingratitude is the world’s reward, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, people will judge you no matter what you do…so you might as well do what you want. And even more take care and cherish the people around you that are good for you while being sceptical to new “false friends” or backstabbing-folks that seem to flood our society more and more for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Fediverse -  A vivid and modern approach to today’s Social Network-landscape</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-i-once-discovered-mastodon-the-fediverse-was-already-a-nice-approach-in-helping-to-rebuild-the-polluted-social-network-landscape&quot;&gt;When I once discovered Mastodon, the Fediverse was already a nice approach in helping to rebuild the polluted Social Network-landscape.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, based upon the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;-protocol, Mastodon isn’t the only player giving hope for federated and decentralized networking. After going with my own Mastodon-instance, I also discovered two additional great services that are valuable additions to the Fediverse - and I don’t want to withhold those from you in case you are interested in learning more about those!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/mastodon_welcome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New folks are being welcomed- Graphic Credits: Mastodon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pixelfed&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finally dumping Instagram in December 2022, I went all in with &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;: After discovering this service in early 2021, I  already tried to free myself from the bounds of Instagram but - let’s be honest - Pixelfed wasn’t ready to follow in Instagram’s step then. The basis was okay and considering the project to be work in progress - and albeit the „little“ version 0.11.6 at the time of writing - the software created by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixelfed.social/dansup&quot;&gt;Daniel Supernault&lt;/a&gt; has heavily progressed over the time. I returned in late 2022, played around and finally created an instance that was playground. Later, it got dumped and on April 21st, my latest instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://nordicshutter.com/&quot;&gt;nordicshutter.com&lt;/a&gt; has opened its gates, welcoming people from Scandinavia and people loving the Scandinavian way of life and the nature there. While the server itself ist hosted in Nürnberg, all media assets are stored in a Wasabi S3-bucket in Frankfurt so no data is being stored or processed outside Germany. Finding the proper way of S3-integration took a while but, over the months, has turned into a solid base for storing media files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/pixelfed_org_website.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pixelfed.org Welcome Site&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus spoken, Pixelfed is still a project under heavy development, but frequent commits are made on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the community is open-minded and various ways of participating are possible, with Dan always being somewhere besides the coding activities, always going with a hint or a helping hand. Once you don’t want to go with an own instance (it still may be tricky if you build and maintain from the scratch if you don’t exactly know what you need to do and in which order things should be done), you can always opt-in for one of the more or less known instances. With choosing the instance you like or which may best reflect your needs and interests, the ActivityPub-aspects of Federation and De-Centralization are put into the focus - just like we know it from Mastodon  - finally leaving Instagram isn’t the big problem anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/nordicshutter_welcome.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Pixelfed-instance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bookwyrm&quot;&gt;BookWyrm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BookWyrm is a solution also built on ActivityPub and a great successor for LibraryThing or GoodReads. By using the protocol Mastodon, Pixelfed and many other are running on, it inter-operates with different instances of BookWyrm and other ActivityPub compliant services. This means you can run an instance for your book club and still follow your friend who posts on a completely different servers with different, book-related collections. It also means that your friend on Mastodon can read and comment on a book review that you post on your BookWyrm-instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/bookwyrm_website.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;How to join BookWyrm&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I used to track my books with a Desktop-based Mac-software named &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bruji.com/bookpedia/&quot;&gt;Bookpedia&lt;/a&gt;. With the relevance of classical apps decreasing and people rather turning to online services, Bookpedia somehow fell behind. Besides myself listening more to audio books than actually reading those (a trend I even consider to be nasty from my own point of view), also the development of Bookpedia seemed to slow down and so the latest iteration 6.2.1 was released by the end of 2021. As times have changed, LibraryThing or GoodReads as modern Internet-based services popped up but when BookWyrm came along, the mixture of self-hosted data-control, ActivityPub-integration and connection to other instances for book background data like ISBN, ASIN, cover artwork etc. made it a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the basic purpose of just cataloguing my bookshelves, I checked out the „mother instance“ &lt;a href=&quot;https://bookwyrm.social/&quot;&gt;bookwyrm.social&lt;/a&gt; and after fetching the look and feel of BookWyrm and because of already hosting my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://norse.social/@oliver&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;- and &lt;a href=&quot;https://nordicshutter.com/oliver&quot;&gt;Pixelfed&lt;/a&gt;-instance, I went to spin up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://books.pifferi.info/&quot;&gt;BookWyrm-instance&lt;/a&gt; as well! The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.joinbookwyrm.com/&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; are written pretty straightforward and despite my love for Docker-based deployments, I went with the non-Dockerized version this time, paired with the same Wasabi-powered S3 storage backend that also fuels my other ActivityPub instances. That being said, BookWyrm is an ideal and modern approach towards a book-reading- and tracking-based service that supports ActivityPub. With following my account on BookWyrm, my friends and followers on Mastodon see what I am currently reading (or listening!) and besides, I finally can track my own reading behavior and the (audio-) books I own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/bookwyrm_pifferi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My BookWyrm-instance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely before I have felt such passion and joy when talking about new trends in the Internet during the last years - or what’s left from the original Internet as it once used to be. With Federation, De-Centralization and growing independence from Big Tech and learning from (at least) Twitter’s demise many people have realized that things must change - and a real change was long overdue. Maybe we don’t need the ad-polluted streams of the common Social Media anymore - maybe we don’t even need the overloaded content there anymore. Maybe stepping back to a more curated, smaller account of contents is the proper way of turning Social Media back to something we may use instead of being the product?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, with great power comes great responsibility and so the moderation of instances (as long as you don’t use a single-user-instance just for your own joys) is a frequent topic within the current growth. Without centralization, there is no single instance taking care of that so it is especially within the responsibility of the instance’s admin to take care of unwanted content or spam etc. - if you like it or not. Based on this, everyone should wisely choose the mother instance of the single services and weight in if the server rules appeal to the specific user’s imagination. While ActivityPub makes its way throughout the web, also the interoperability between instances is still a challenge: While Mastodon at least offers the options to move an account to another domain, this option and especially contents like likes, media etc. are still to be integrated in Pixelfed and BookWyrm - the goal: No one wanting to switch to another instance should start from zero or manually repost everything (which is, experienced by myself, a torture!) piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/fedidb_stats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stats from fedidb.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the Fediverse is growing and there are lots of products waiting for us to discover them. Pixelfed-founder Daniel Supernault is also taking care of &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedidb.org/&quot;&gt;FediDB&lt;/a&gt;, a project summing up statistics for the Fediverse and the single software solutions empowering it. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fedidb.org/software&quot;&gt;big amount of software available and many platforms&lt;/a&gt; are waiting for new users - by using the ActivityPub-protocol, all these single places can talk to each other, like posts from other platforms and even boost those. Less poison, less hate, less misunderstanding and the connections between single software components founded on the ActivityPub-protocol are about to revive the „classic“ Internet from earlier days and I hope that this trend will get strengthened, opening the door for a decentralized social media of many kinds apart from the Big Tech-monoliths that somehow seem to be rather old-fashioned and boring when being compared to this movement of modern, federated Social Networks in the internet of the 2020s!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How to upgrade Debian 11 Bullseye to Debian 12 Bookworm</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;yesterday-the-latest-iteration-of-debian-linux-in-version-12-codename-bookworm-was-released-everyone-of-you-thinking-that-a-direct-upgrade-to-the-new-system-is-essential-at-this-early-stage-may-do-so-as-many-package-have-been-updated&quot;&gt;Yesterday, the latest iteration of Debian Linux in version 12, codename „Bookworm“ was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/releases/bookworm/&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone of you thinking that a direct upgrade to the new system is essential at this early stage may do so as many package have been updated.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amongst them was PHP so that other repositories aren’t necessary anymore for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, with great power comes great responsibility so you should know what you are doing, not caring if you use Debian for private usage or as the strong foundation for server-based services like I do: First of all, backup your valuable files, snapshot the virtual machine or do a full backup your environments with trustworthy solutions like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.veeam.com/de/linux-backup-free.html&quot;&gt;Veeam&lt;/a&gt;. Although the update-process is pretty straightforward and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUpgrade&quot;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt;, things may happen and break your environment or specific services so the motto should always be „backup early, backup often“. Apart from that, you can pursue the following steps to bring your system from Debian 11 „Bullseye“ to Debian 12 „Bookworm“:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/lukas-NLSXFjl_nhc-unsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update-currently-installed-packages&quot;&gt;Update Currently Installed Packages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the release upgrade, it is recommended to update all your currently installed packages to their latest versions. This is something you may already do regularly but it’s essential to take care of this before this version upgrade. Packages marked as „held back“ cannot be automatically installed, upgraded or removed. This may cause issues during the upgrade process which we try to bypass. To check whether there are held back packages on your systems or not, just run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt-mark showhold&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any „on hold“-packages, you should either unhold the packages with „sudo apt-mark unhold packagename“ or make sure the packages will not interfere with the upgrade process itself. After3wards, we need to refresh the packages-index and upgrade all installed packages just as it is done everytime:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also run „apt full-upgrade“ to perform a major version upgrade of the installed packages and simultaneously remove some unnecessary packages by using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt full-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we want to get rid of some garbage aka. automatically installed dependencies that are no longer needed by any package:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt autoremove&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;upgrading-debian-11-bullseye-to-debian-12-bookworm&quot;&gt;Upgrading Debian 11 Bullseye to Debian 12 Bookworm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to reconfigure APT’s source-list files so that only the „Bookworm“-repositories will be used in the future. To do so, you can either open the /etc/apt/sources.list file with your text editor and replace each instance of bullseye with bookworm and bullseye/updates to bookworm-security. If you have other source-list files under /etc/apt/sources.list.d, you must update those sources, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default file /etc/apt/sources.list on Bullseye looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, before choosing to manually edit those files, we can also make use of Linux’ „sed“-command and let the following three lines handle this for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo sed -i &apos;s/bullseye/bookworm/g&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo sed -i &apos;s/bullseye/bookworm/g&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo sed -i &apos;s#/debian-security bookworm/updates# bookworm-security#g&apos; /etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once Once done, update the packages index from the new repositories for the first time by using the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are any errors or warning messages related to a third-party repository, try fixing the issue or disabling the repository as it may prevent a successfully upgrade (or make it at least a little bit more complicated). Then, start the system upgrade by finally upgrading the installed packages. This will upgrade only those packages that don’t require any other packages to be installed or removed and is executed by the well-known&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be asked if you want specific services being restarted during this upgrade - this may lead to a short service interruption for the restart-process so if you are, for example, updating your SSH-config, be sure that a service restart doesn’t interrupt your session. In this case it’s always better to use the hypervisor-based console or the monitor attached to the bare-metal-system you may update!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore and during the upgrade process, you may also be asked various other questions, like whether you want to keep an existing configuration file or to install the package maintainer’s version. Please read the information carefully and if you never made any custom changes to the file it is safe to type „Y“. Otherwise, to keep the current configuration, enter „N“ - in my case, existing configurations for NGINX or SSH were kept the ways I have customized them. Depending on your Internet-connection and the amount of packages being updated, the upgrade process may take some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally and after mastering this stage, execute an „apt full-upgrade“ which will perform a complete upgrade of the system, install the newest versions of the packages, and resolve the dependency changes between packages in different releases. This will upgrade all packages that were not upgraded with the previous command and put everything else in the proper order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cleaning-up-and-going-live&quot;&gt;Cleaning up and going live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After going through the previous steps, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo apt autoremove&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will clean up unnecessary packages and a final reboot with typing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo systemctl reboot&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;finally takes care of getting your upgraded Debian 12-system online so that you can check whether everything is running fine - or not (followed by a certain troubleshooting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once back again, you can check the status of your freshly-upgraded system by typing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;uname -a ; lsb_release -a_&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which should finally show you a running Debian 12 Bookworm and a Linux 6.x-kernel running underneath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We successfully managed upgrading from Debian 11 to Debian 12 which is a quite easy, painless and reliable process once all prerequisites are met although a backup or snapshot should always be in reach for the one thing that goes down according to Murphy’s Law!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The best way to predict your future is to create it</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;while-the-past-is-gone-and-the-future-still-is-still-ahead-abraham-lincolns-famous-quote-can-be-a-synonym-for-a-proactive-way-of-influencing-events-that-are-still-ahead&quot;&gt;While the past is gone and the future still is still ahead, Abraham Lincoln’s famous quote can be a synonym for a proactive way of influencing events that are still ahead.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve pulled the plug. After months (summing up to years?) of anger, desperation, lack of perspective, sluggishness, avolition and familiar impact in terms of health and &lt;a href=&quot;https://forhekset.com/posts/Death-smiles-at-us-all-a-man-can-do-is-smile-back/&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;, we finally made it to Denmark (a long-time goal on our family’s holiday shortlist) with the kids to create a distance between the daily &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.pifferi.info/goodbye-2020-it-just-wasn-t-a-pleasure&quot;&gt;burden&lt;/a&gt; - at least for a single week. Although being to Denmark before, the country was more or less a „jumphost“ for our ventures to Norway. This time, it gets at least a one-week-attention with the family-focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to recharge, time to refocus, time to get away from everything that is harming the everyday’s life. For me, there is no better cure than the sea and especially (especially, especially!) the sea. All sorrows are gone if I venture to the beach, sit down there and enjoy the grace of weather, tide and the sand there. While time is seemingly stopping, my inner self comes to rest and gets time to reflect many, many things. The life is different near the sea and the everyday-disturbances you know from your hamster running wheel at home are simply gone and forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are decisions to made in the near future and decisions that have already been made to get back on a track in certain situations.  As I am the kind of human who judges by pro- and contra-arguments, there are always aspects weighting in for one side or the other but when I opt in for one, it’s a final decision and - usually - turning back isn’t on my agenda. Basically, you will never know what you get with each decision but - on the other hand - won’t ever make the experience what could happen if you never dare to decide anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/hvide_sande_lighthouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hvide Sande Lighthouse, Denmark - Photo Courtesy of Author&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thinking about the future in the one or other aspect, life focuses on my family, my wife, my kids and hobbies which never get the attention they usually deserve. Re-gaining this focus, I find the time to create my own future in a certain way. Not all parts of my life will be affected, but there is a time for new challenges and moving on. Therefore, a precise prediction of my future in all aspects remains (of course!) uncertain, but getting actively involved into its creation may stop the hamster wheel and open a door while another one will be shut in the short term. Sometimes and occasionally, opportunities that needs to be grabbed simply stumble upon your way, giving you a new perspective!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait for your future to be created by you. Take the time to re-focus, „pull the plug“ and think about the things that are good for you - and sort out those aspects that aren’t. Often it just needs a specific distance to find a solution - and someone with a helping hand and a perspective, clearing things up. You won’t play an active part in the way the universe works, but you can put the things on the right track to somehow benefit from it: Both your personal wellbeing and your family will be grateful for that proactive attitude towards changing your own’s future!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Dark Noise: Simple. Fast. White noise, refined!</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-anthrax-released-their-famous-album-the-sound-of-white-noise-back-in-1993-aiming-for-silence-and-harmony-wasnt-the-main-focus-today-dark-noise-is-a-tool-willing-to-phase-down-the-pace-of-everyday-life-by-providing-natural-sounds-on-all-apple-based-oses-striving-for-calmness&quot;&gt;When Anthrax released their famous album „The Sound of White Noise“ back in 1993, aiming for silence and harmony wasn’t the main focus. Today, Dark Noise is a tool willing to phase down the pace of everyday life by providing natural sounds on all Apple-based OSes, striving for calmness.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/dark-noise-hero-v3-transparent.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With noise, permanent office talks and similar sounds all around it’s difficult to focus on anything. I often discover myself to be simply fed up with senseless conversations (just to talk anything at all) or permanent muttering all around: Especially if you’ve got kids of nearly all ages, there IS always a variety of sounds all around preventing from focusing on anything. I like the expression that „a lot of people think I’m unhappy because I’m quiet“. In fact I’m not unhappy, I just appreciate silence in a world that never stops talking!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having this in mind, Dark Noise, which has recently been released in Version 3.0, closes the gap of just isolating yourself from the noises outside - for a variety of reasons. The app itself has a certain history - v1.0 was released in August 2019 on iOS, v2.0 followed in July 2020 with mixing capabilities and the feature of syncing these mixes via iCloud to each device associated with the specific Apple-account. In May 2021, v2.5 finally made the step to the Mac&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wsMA6Du03J8&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
.embed-container {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;
  height: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  max-width: 100%;
}
.embed-container iframe,
.embed-container object,
.embed-container embed {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and these days, version 3.0 was released, introducing of a free tier. This includes access to eight free sounds as well as full support for infinitely looping sounds, Shortcuts, Siri integration, and the Timer-feature. The app itself is built pretty straightforward - developer Charly Chapman is, by his own words, building software for eight years and pretty new to the iOS-scene. Putting this aside, the level of maturity on Dark Noise is quite impressive as the main goal - providing environment sounds - can be achieved without any hassle: Browse through the list, pick your sound and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/screenshot_mac_03.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While each sound stands for his own, I especially like the mixing feature: Putting beach and seagulls together, I combine my own favorite and mind-tranquilizing scenario at ease! Everyone of you liking windy trees together with some kind of rain and crickets can mix this as well - and even if you like the soundscape of a coffee shop with a construction side nearby paired with the sound of a city street, you will be able to make up the preferred sound setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charly Chapman is also providing the possibility of either &lt;a href=&quot;https://tally.so/r/wAzPGk&quot; title=&quot;Request a New Sound Form&quot;&gt;request a specific sound&lt;/a&gt; to be added to Dark Noise or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tally.so/r/wdEq4A&quot; title=&quot;Request a Feature Form&quot;&gt;request a feature&lt;/a&gt; while providing support to all additional questions besides the &lt;a href=&quot;https://darknoise.app/help&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; by E-Mail. In my personal use case, I often stumbled upon apps that were aiming towards providing sound sets to calm down, relax, re-focus or just turn away from the classic Apple Music- or Spotify-based playlists. Many crossed my path but Dark Noise is definitely here to stay: Apart from the variety of sounds, there are two features that I would personally consider as unique selling point: The mixer and the iCloud-sync which even enhance the custom mixes by simply putting them on my iPhone and iPad after I have created them on my Mac. Also the Siri-integration or support of Shortcuts is a big plus that raises Dark Noise above the common masses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/dark-noise-pro-compare.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dark Noise 3.0 is available on Apple’s App Store to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-noise/id1465439395&quot; title=&quot;download for free&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; for free. Dark Noise Pro is currently available for 2,99 EUR a month, 22,99 EUR a year with a 3 day trial, or a one-time-purchase for 59,99 EUR while the US-Dollar prices slights vary. According to the App Store and the developer’s privacy policy, no data is collected during the usage of the app - by June 2020, Firebase-and Crashlytics-reporting and analytics have been removed from the app and anonymous TelemetryDeck-analytics can be opted-out from within the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pricing is okay and fair, especially if you go with a yearly plan - and, according to your use case, the one-timer may also make sense in terms of supporting an indie developer which once had a great idea and has now made all the proper steps to be successful with Dark Noise on all major Apple-based platforms!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>How to install PHP 8.2 on Debian 11</title>
                <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;although-debian-is-a-modern-linux-distribution-based-upon-stability-it-sometimes-misses-actual-packages-like-the-latest-php-iteration&quot;&gt;Although Debian is a modern Linux-distribution based upon stability, it sometimes misses actual packages like the latest PHP-iteration.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.debian.org/&quot;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; 11, released on August 14th, 2021 with version 11.0, is more than one year available at the time of writing. The latest stable PHP-version, a foundation for many web services and use cases, is currently 8.2. After nearly one year, the latest PHP-iteration you can install on a modern Debian 11-system is still 7.4. While stability is - undoubtedly - still a key feature, the improvements from PHP 8.x are numerous with the factor „performance“ in the focus. This short but sweet tutorial shall show you how to safely install &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.php.net/&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; 8.2 on a modern Debian-11-system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, there is still a rational boundary for not always going with the latest versions of software packages. Anyway, depending on your own needs and used software, the change from PHP 7.4 to 8.x brings an enormous boost for all applications that rely on the latest PHP-version and have adopted their code to take advantage of the various improvements. Enabling our system to fetch the latest package is the key factor here and to gain this, we need to add the well-known repositories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://deb.sury.org/&quot;&gt;Ondřej Surý&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;adding-the-repository&quot;&gt;Adding the repository&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ondřej Surý is the main Debian packager for PHP and other packages under DEB.SURY.ORG name you may already have encountered when venturing the web. As a service to the community he provides Ubuntu-PPAs for PHP, Apache2, nginx and others that are widely used. He also runs personal Debian packaging repository located at &lt;a href=&quot;https://packages.sury.org&quot;&gt;https://packages.sury.org&lt;/a&gt; and is told to be the best focal point for PHP-packages away from the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our Debian system, be sure that the „curl“ package is installed. If not, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install curl
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;does the trick before the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -sSL https://packages.sury.org/php/README.txt | sudo bash -x
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will install the basic repository. On Ubuntu-systems, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;takes care of the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update all repositories and update some components, do a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to ensure your system is ready for all further installation tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having met all prerequisites, it’s now time to finally get familiar with PHP 8.2. To install the basic module, use the command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install php8.2-fpm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, after conforming your choose, the FPM-version of PHP will be installed. To check whether you did succeed or not, a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;php -v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is always a good choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further modules can be additionally installed depending upon your needs, for example the GD- and Curl-modules can be added via&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt install php8.2-gd php8.2-curl 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in no time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;verdict&quot;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With quite no efforts, we managed to install the latest iteration of PHP 8.x on our Debian 11-system. Further updates and security fixes will make use of the recently added repositories of Ondřej Surý. While the latest Ubuntu-version already brings PHP 8.2 from the scratch, older versions can also be equipped with this version by the alternative command above.&lt;/p&gt;
