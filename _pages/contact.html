Midgard Mates is entirely staffed by (currently) a single person who is passionate about Technology and many other topics.<br/><br/>

There’s a lot of stuff happening in the Tech-sector and the world at any given time. If you could tell us a little bit about what’s going on, that helps us keep track of the story and helps to develop new thoughts, ideas and...  of course... stories!<br/><br/>

Generally speaking, a tip is a juicy bit of information about something happening on the network. Some examples:<br/><br/>

<ul><li>A new platform just added a huge new feature that changes how it’s used!
<li>Somebody’s working to solve a really hard problem and made important progress other should know of!
<li>This or that community over here or there is doing a cool thing!
<li>Somebody is just forking another great application that should be tracked
<li>This company over here is implementing ActivityPub to join, for example, the Fediverse!
<li>This particular community drama highlights an important social issue which should be covered!
<li>These events in our everyday's life just need some coverage as they are probably connected to the Tech-sector</li></ul>
