## Although Microsoft was quite fast with bringing native Office desktop-apps to Apple Silicon in no time, it was quite a long journey for Teams to catch up.

Anyway, miracles happen! After the first version were already in sight [this April](https://pifferi.synology.me/microsoft-silently-releases-m1-optimized-teams-client-for-mac/), Microsoft [officially announced](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/announcing-microsoft-teams-optimized-for-apple-silicon/ba-p/3589463?ref=pifferi.synology.me) the general availability of the Teams-client for Apples M1- and M2 Apple Silicon-based SoCs.

Now, Redmond is currently rolling out a production grade Universal Binary version of the software. This will run natively on the entire Mac lineup including those with Apple silicon and the Intel-versions. For users of Apples own chipsets this means a significant boost in performance, ensuring efficient use of device resources paired with an optimized Teams-experience even when using multiple high-resolution monitors during calls or meetings - just like the early preview already promised.

All installed clients will be updated automatically in the well-known increments over the coming months so not every user will instantly get the update now. At the time of writing, there isnâ€™t an official download link as the official site still leads to the Intel-based version while a preview in iteration 1.5.00.20352 can be downloaded [here](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-osx/1.5.00.20352/Teams_osx.pkg?ref=pifferi.synology.me) or [here](https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/production-osx/1.5.00.21565/Teams_osx.pkg?ref=pifferi.synology.me) (public preview build 1.5.00.21565).
