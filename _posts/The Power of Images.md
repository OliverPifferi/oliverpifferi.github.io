# The Power of Images

When I once discovered Mastodon, the Fediverse was already a nice approach in helping to rebuild the polluted Social Network-landscape. But, based upon the [ActivityPub][1]-protocol, Mastodon isn’t the only player giving hope for federated and decentralized networking. After going with my own Mastodon-instance, I also discovered two additional great services that are valuable additions to the Fediverse - and I don’t want to withhold those from you in case you are interested in learning more about those!

## Travelling

Thinking back, I was always some kind of traveling guy. While my family is more homegrown, its traveling history is somehow divided: Two of my grandparents (father’s side) always stayed in the town they were born and the ultimate journey was a three-hours drive while the other two (mother’s side) experienced the Nazi-occupation in Poland and fled to Germany without my grandpa who worked in Finland for many years. „Henry the Conqueror“, as we used to call him, also worked as a piano player on one of the big cruise ships and did not only see Finland but also nearly all parts of the world.

While the latter always tried to teach me to play piano (and never succeeded) he ignited the flame of traveling in my younger self by telling his stories and showing slides from his journey, proving that there’s more than a tunnel vision in terms of seeing the world and other sites and cultures.

The flame burnt slowly but with getting older, I discovered that seeing other cultures, other people and foreign countries apart from classical German travel-destinations is something that absolutely fascinated me. Today, this desire is nearly unbearable as it is always connected with free time and colliding family obligations. And yes, I think that the right person teaching you that there is always something behind one’s own horizon paired with a specific curiousness for the new, for the undiscovered, for the unknown, can be the vital spark for turning an open-minded human being into someone with a certain desire to travel.
