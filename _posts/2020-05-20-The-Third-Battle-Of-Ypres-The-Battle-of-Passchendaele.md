## On July 31st, 1917 - nearly 103 years ago - the Third Battle of Ypres, also known as the Battle of Passchendaele - took place on the Western Front.

It lasted three months, one week and three days and ended on November 10th, 1917 with the Canadian Corps capturing Passchendaele.⁣

⁣The number of casualties is named with 400.000 to 800.000 and still today, Paschendale (as the English version is pronounced) is a synonym for yet another senseless waste of lifes and resources without any markable wins on territory, the so-called "Verdun of Belgium".

The English poet-soldier Siegfried Sassoon wrote once: „I died in hell (They called it Passchendaele)” and so we can just assume what horrors happened there once.⁣

Lest we forget.
