## The 80s weren’t so bad after all…

Sometimes it takes many years to appreciate the first decade you’ve grown up in.

Although I rather remember the 90s-era, the 80s had definitely their own charm which I fell in love with during the last two years. It’s hard to guess why this has happened - maybe a lot of spare time during the COVID-19 pandemic rummaging around in the murkiest corner of your brain? Maybe seeing videos and reading stories about the 80th? It’s quite difficult to grasp and although I like the technical amenities of the 21st century, I always catch up with asking the question if life has been better these days…

As a kid born in 1978, the eighties were the first decade I experienced consciously. My first home (with a toilet downstairs without a radiator), my first school, the fall of the Berlin Wall - and the synthesizer-based music that occupied the charts. Compact Discs entering the market (hint: DDD was the best quality and often matched Pink Floyd’s releases!) after I got to know my first Sony Walkman and - finally - Cable TV that brought us five instead of three programs! Yes - Germany was quite stunted these days but the first appearance of David Hasselhoff in „Knight Rider“ was something that manifested into my brain.

Mentioning the car that outacted the performer, TV-shows were something very special these days and the charm they got accompanied by is something that really got lost today: The A-Team, Miami Vice, Captain Future, The Fall Guy, Sledge Hammer - legends of television! Focusing on movies, I grew up with Star Wars, the Back to the Future-trilogy, Highlander, Indiana Jones

…

What do you think? Would life be better if we’d experience our „lifecycle“ in the 80s, despite the threat of the dying Cold War and analogue technology? Would it be different, would our own personalities and the way we work be different? Would we be happier in the era where television had fewer programs but lovelier shows? I always got hold of me thinking what may happen if we just could turn back the wheel of time…

Let me know your thoughts if you like and tell me if these thoughts are just sentimental connections to the past or something you would - partly - agree with!
