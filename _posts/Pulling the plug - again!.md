# Pulling the plug - again!

## While our world hastens more and more, we need to take care of not getting outdistanced. Everyone has an own way of juggling the daily routine - ours was to pull the plug and enjoy the beauty of Norse nature, once again.

The scenario was too familiar - put some nice folks together, drive to Northern Denmark and embark on a ferry to Norway. Basically, it was the same routine we discovered in 2021 but this time with four guys and an eleven-hour ferry-travel instead of the three hours last year. Midsummer was near and while we still didnâ€™t manage to reach the mid of Norway, the impressions were once again phenomenal and have shown that there is still so much to explore in this world plagued by turmoils.
