## The Sea

People are different and so are the things that drive us forward, giving us the power we need in everyday’s life.

While some people draw their energy from the mountains, being alone in the woods or by traveling to some party locations my element is the sea, the water, the coast(s). This is quite strange as I was not born near a coast or a place close to it but this liaison somehow developed over the years.

Since the outbreak in early 2020, COVID-19 has fortified the feeling that, while being stuck in your own place of living, your mind thirsts for freedom and so your body does trying to get some fuel to regenerate from the obstacles of everyday’s life.

This year, we returned to the Belgian Coast at Bredene-an-Zee as we did the years before (even in 2020 before the lockdowns) and although the weather was quite (wechselhaft) and moderate, I left the house each morning at 8:15 to spend some time jogging. While I nearly gave up jogging at home (due to running always the same track and the lack of motivation), I discovered that jogging and walking to the nearby coast was my perfect choice for fueling up my mind before the rest of the day started.
